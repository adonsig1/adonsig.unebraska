<tr> <td align="left"><a name="AP">Allan Peterson</th> <td align="left">A time scale <i>T</i> is just a 
closed nonempty subset of the real numbers. Time scales include the real numbers, the integers, and 
the Cantor set. Given a smooth function <i>p(t)</i> defined on a time scale and a point <i>s</i> in
the time scale we will define a generalized exponential function <i>e<sub>p</sub>(t,s)</i> which generalizes 
the exponetial function <i>e<sup>pt</sup></i> studied in calculus. Many beautiful properties of 
this generalized exponential function will be examined.</td></tr>
<tr> <td align="left"><a name="JR">Jamie Radcliffe</th> <td align="left">The physical notion of entropy has spawned a variety of mathematical analogues, one of which is the notion of the
entropy of a random variable. Recently there have been a variety of results in combinatorics proved by estimating
the entropy of random variables naturally associated with a combinatorial problem. I will discuss the definition
and meaning of entropy, and also some of the results that have been proved using this technique.</td></tr>
<tr> <td align="left"><a name="GL">Glenn Ledder</th> <td align="left">In the multidimensional space of academia, 
the mathematical modeling region
intersects both the mathematics region and the science region, which do not
directly intersect each other.  Or, to borrow a metaphor from biology,
mathematical modeling is the tendon that connects the muscle of mathematics
to the skeleton of science.  Mathematical modelers employ mathematical
methods in the study of science problems, but they do much more than that.
They provide a critical analysis of the conceptual models that underlie
scientific theories.
</td></tr>
<tr> <td align="left"><a name="MW">Mark Walker</th> <td align="left">Algebraic geometry 
is one of the largest and oldest branches of mathematics. What's more, the subject has undergone at least two
"revolutions" since its inception. The first, due to Oscar Zariski
and others, linked algebraic geometry with commutative algebra, and
the two fields have been intertwined ever since. The second was due to
Alexander Grothendieck and his followers, and it resulted in a
tremendous abstraction of the subject.  For these reasons, summarizing
what the entire field of algebraic geometry is all about is a rather
daunting task.

<p><i>K</i>-theory is also a rather vast subject area, having connections with
algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, algebraic topology,
number theory, and even operator algebra.
The flavor of <i>K</i>-theory that I am most mostly interested in concerns its
applications to algebraic geometry.

<p>In my talk, I will attempt to give a flavor of these subjects by talking
about some things of current interest to me.</td></tr>

<tr> <td align="left"><a name="GA">George Avalos</th> <td align="left">
Semidiscrete finte difference and finite element method numerical approximation schemes are presented for
the null controllability of two non-standard parabolic PDE control systems. The key feature here is that the
null controllers being approximated exhibit the asymptotics of the associated minimal energy function. This
is joint work with Michael Gunderson and Scott Hottovy.</td> </tr>
<dt> <td align="left"><a name="SH">Susan Hermiller</th> <td align="left">
Group theory originated in chemistry, in the study
of symmetries of crystal lattices. Current avenues
of research still include studying a group by studying
a space for which it is a group of symmetries. In my
talk I'll describe some examples of reflection groups.

<p>If someone wants to read a bit more after the talk, it might be best if 
they come and chat with Professor Hermiller, who could tailor suggested references
to their interests.  One nice exposition is a paper by Martin Bridson:
<a href="http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/~bridson/papers/bfs/">
The Geometry of the Word Problem</a>.</td> </tr>
<dt> <td align="left"><a name="CK">Christine Kelley</th> <td align="left">
Coding theory is the study of how to reliably and efficiently transmit information from one point in space
(or time) to another. The origins of coding theory are attributed to Shannon in 1948 who proved the
existence of good codes, and Hamming in 1949 who gave the first explicit code construction. Coding theory
lies in the intersection of mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science, and relies on tools
from a broad range of mathematics. In this talk, we will look at some basic families of codes and
communication channels, and discuss some of the current directions in this area.
