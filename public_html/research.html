<H3> Rough and Ready Summary </H3>

My research interests are in operator algebras and operator theory.
This subject is a mix of algebra and analysis.
It has important applications in physics, such as quantum mechanics
and quantum field theory.
There is a long standing theme in mathematics of understanding spaces
in terms of the functions on those spaces.
The commutative self-adjoint operator algebras are the
natural function algebras on a topological space or a measure space.
Topological or measure-theoretic questions about the space can be 
translated into algebraic questions about the commutative operator
algebra.
Motivated partly by this and partly by other topics, the study of
non-commutative (selfadjoint) operator algebras can be viewed as
`non-commutative topology' and `non-commutative measure theory'.<p> 

My own work is focuses on non-selfadjoint operator algebras.
These correspond, in the sense of the previous paragraph, to the 
study of analytic functions.
One interest of mine is limit algebras, which are infinite dimensional
algebras obtained as limits of sequences of finite dimensional algebras,
each embedded inside the next.<p>

<dt> <font size=+1>Norms of Schur Multipliers</font> (with
	<a HREF="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~krdavids/">Ken Davidson</a>),
<dd> <i>Abstract:</i>  A subset P of N x N is called Schur bounded if every 
infinite matrix with
bounded entries which is zero off of P yields a bounded Schur multiplier on
B(H). Such sets are characterized as being the union of a subset with at most k
entries in each row with another that has at most k entries in each column, for
some finite k. If k is optimal, there is a Schur multiplier supported on the
pattern with norm O(k^(1/2)), which is sharp up to a constant.
<p>The same techniques give a new, more elementary proof of results of
Varopoulos and Pisier on Schur multipliers with given matrix entries of random
sign.
<p>We consider the Schur multipliers for certain matrices which have a large
symmetry group. In these examples, we are able to compute the Schur multiplier
norm exactly. This is carried out in detail for a few examples including the
Kneser graphs.</p>

<dd> <i>Abstract:</i>  Partial actions of discrete abelian groups can be
used to construct both groupoid C*-algebras and
partial crossed product algebras.  
In each case there is a natural notion of an analytic subalgebra.  
We show that for countable subgroups of <b>R</b> and free partial actions, 
these constructions yield the same C*-algebras and the same analytic
subalgebras.
We also show that under suitable hypotheses an analytic
partial crossed product preserves all the information
in the dynamical system in the sense that two analytic
partial crossed products are isomorphic as Banach algebras
if, and only if, the partial actions are conjugate.<p>

<dd> <i>Abstract:</i>We show that the spectrum of a triangular regular limit algebra
	(TAF algebra) is an invariant for algebraic isomorphism.  Combining this with 
	previous results provides a striking rigidity property: two triangular 
	regular limit algebras are algebraically isomorphic if and only if they 
	are isometrically isomorphic.  A consequence of spectral invariance is 
	a structure theorem for isomorphisms between limit algebras.
	The proof of the main theorem makes use of a characterization of the
	completely meet irreducible ideals of a TAF algebra and a dual space
	formulation of the spectrum.<p>

<dd> <i>Abstract:</i> Kadison's transitivity theorem implies that, for irreducible 
	representations of C*-algebras, every invariant linear manifold is closed.
     	It is known that CSL algebras have this propery if, and only if, the lattice 
	is hyperatomic (every projection is generated by a finite
	number of atoms). We show several other conditions are equivalent, including 
	the conditon that every invariant linear manifold is singly generated. 
        We show that two families of norm closed operator algebras have this property.
	First, let L be a CSL and suppose A is a norm closed algebra which is weakly 
	dense in Alg L and is a bimodule over the (not necessarily closed) algebra 
	generated by the atoms of L. If L is hyperatomic and the compression of A to 
	each atom of L is a C*-algebra, then every linear manifold invariant under A 
	is closed. Secondly, if A is the image of a strongly maximal triangular AF 
	algebra under a multiplicity free nest representation, where the nest has 
	order type -N, then every linear manifold invariant under A is closed and 
	is singly generated.<p>

<dd> <i>Abstract:</i> This paper studies meet-irreducible ideals, that is, 
	ideals <i>I</i> so that if <i>I</i> is the intersection of two ideals, 
	then  one of the two ideals must equal <i>I</i>, in certain direct 
	limit algebras. The limit algebras are usually strongly maximal 
	triangular subalgebras of AF C*-algebras.<p>
	We give descriptions of these ideals in terms of coordinates.
	Meet-irreducible ideals are interesting because they are closely 
	related to nest representations; in particular, we show that each 
	meet-irreducible ideal is the kernel of a nest representation.
	We obtain a distance formula for ideals analogous to Arveson's 
	distance formula for nest algebras.
	Finally, the subset of completely meet-irreducible ideals (they satisfy
	the same property for an arbitrary intersection) is shown to be 
	isomorphic to the spectrum of the limit algebra, for certain limit

<dd> <i>Abstract:</i> We develop an isomorphism invariant for limit algebras:
	an extension of Power's strong algebraic order on the scale of the 
	<i>K_0</i>-group (Power, J. Operator Theory 27 1992, 87--106).
	This invariant is complete for a certain family of limit algebras:
	inductive limits of digraph algebras (a.k.a.\ finite dimensional CSL 
	algebras) satisfying two conditions: 
	(1) the inclusions of the digraph algebras respect the order-preserving
	normalisers, and
	(2) the digraph algebras have chordal digraphs.
	The first condition is also used to show that the invariant depends 
	only on the limit algebra and not the direct system.
	We give an intrinsic characterisation of the limit algebras satisfying
	both~(1) and~(2).<p>

<dd> <i>Abstract:</i> We show that limit algebras having interpolating 
	spectrum are characterized by the property that all locally 
	contractive representations have *-dilations.
	This extends a result for digraph algebras by Davidson.
	It is an open question if such a limit algebra is the limit of 
	a direct system of digraph algebras with interpolating digraphs,
	although a positive answer would allow one to obtain one direction 
	of our result directly from Davidson's.
	Instead, we give a `local' construction of digraph algebras with 
	interpolating digraphs and use this to extend representations.<p>

	Tree algebras (in the sense of Davidson, Paulsen, and Power) have been 
	characterized by a commutant lifting property among digraph algebras 
	with interpolating digraphs.
	We show that the analogous result holds for limit algebras, i.e.,
	limit algebras with the analogous spectral condition are characterized 
	by the same commutant lifting property among the limit algebras

<dd> <i>Abstract:</i> A 4-cycle algebra is a finite dimensional digraph 
	algebra (CSL algebra) whose reduced digraph is a 4-cycle. A rigid 
	embedding between such algebras is a direct sum of certain 
	nondegenerate multiplicity one star-extendible embeddings. 
	A complete classification is obtained for the regular
	isomorphism classes of direct systems  $A$  of 4-cycle algebras
	with respect to rigid embeddings.
	The critical invariant is a binary relation in the direct sum of 
	<i>K<sub>0</sub> A</i> and  <i>H<sub>1</sub> A</i>,
	generalising the scale of the $K<sub>0</sub>$-group, called the joint 
	scale.
	The joint scale encapsulates other invariants and compatibility 
	conditions of regular isomorphism. 
	These include the scale of <i>H<sub>1</sub> A</i>, the scale of the
	direct sum of <i>H<sub>0</sub> A</i> and <i>H<sub>1</sub> A </i> 	
	sign compatibility, congruence compatibility and 
	<i>H<sub>0</sub> H<sub>1</sub></i> coupling classes. 
	These invariants are also important for lifting (<i>K<sub>0</sub></i> 
	direct sum <i>H<sub>1</sub></i>)
	isomorphisms to algebra isomorphisms; we resolve this lifting problem 
	for various classes of 4-cycle algebra  direct systems.<p>

	block matrix, where the (1,1) entry is a nest algebra, the (4,4)
	entry is a reflexive algebra and the (1,2) entry is a reflexive
	subspace.  In this paper, we study the derivations from a semi-nest

	when the first homology group of the algebra is contained in the

	obstruction to a derivation being inner arises from the (4,4) entry.
	In particular, the <i>H<sub>1</sub></i>-group of the algebra vanishes
	if the (4,4) entry is a direct sum of nest algebras or is selfadjoint.
	If the algebra is not a CSL algebra, then this fails; for example,

	their lattices of closed two-sided ideals.  Not (isometrically)
	isomorphic algebras can have isomorphic lattices of ideals; indeed, 
	there is an uncountable family of pairwise non-isomorphic algebras,
	all with isomorphic lattices of ideals.  In the positive direction,
	if <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are strongly maximal TAF algebras with
	isomorphic lattices of ideals, then there is a bijective isometry
	between the subalgebras of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> generated by

	the sum of an algebra isomorphism and an anti-isomorphism.  Using

	to show that there are TAF algebras whose lattices of ideals can not

	normalizers.  Our techniques rely on constructing a topological
	binary relation based on the lattice of ideals; this realtion is 
	closely connected to the spectrum or fundamental relation (also a 
	topological binary relation) of the TAF algebra.<p>

	a triangular AF algebra which can be written using the standard
