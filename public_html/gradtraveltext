Advice on Filling out the Graduate Student Travel Request Form

The department aims to fund all reasonable travel requests.  If you
clearly and briefly explain the professional benefits of the trip and 
why your request is reasonable, then you'll get a quicker response and
be more likely to have your full request funded.

Explain the benefits.  You should explain why you are taking this trip.
For example, 
    -you might be giving a talk (explain what kind of talk and how long), 
    -you might be graduating and want to go the annual meeting as part of 
	your job search,   
    -you've been invited to give a talk at another university, or
    -you're going to a meeting to hear talks in your research area.

Share the costs.  If several people are traveling to the same conference
or event, make an effort to share lodgings, rental cars, and so on.
If you are traveling as part of a group (a semigroup?), each person should
submit his or her own form, clearly indicating what that person is paying for.
It is very helpful to submit the requests together.

Justify the costs.  If it is cheaper for several people to fly to a nearby 
airport and rent a car, say so.  If you are sharing lodging, say so.

Proofread.  Be sure you've added the costs correctly, that only one
person is asking for money for the hotel room, that the registration fee
is the right one for your status, and so on.

Follow up.  If you haven't heard back in a day or so, check with Liz.
Be sure to keep all receipts and to submit your reimbursement request in
a timely way---more than 60 days after the trip, we can't reimburse you.  
It's state law.
